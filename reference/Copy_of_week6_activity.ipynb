        "\n",
        "**Objective:** Learn how to build and run a LangChain client and MCP server that communicate through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). You will understand how MCP enables LLMs to safely interact with external tools and data sources, and how LangChain can integrate these capabilities to create more powerful and extensible AI agents.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this activity, you will set up an MCP environment, implement a basic MCP server exposing simple tools, and connect it to a LangChain-based client that invokes these tools through natural language prompts. You will then observe how the client sends requests, the server responds with results, and analyze how this protocol supports tool-based reasoning.\n",
